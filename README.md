## Open_SfM_METU
Self calibration technique integration to the structure from motion pipeline
including radial distortion removal and focal length estimation 

Open_SfM_METU is structure from motion (SfM) pipeline in which both self calibration from two views for sequential SfM and calibration for all the cameras in global SfM are provided. 

## Motivation

In the scope of this project, two views calibration algorithm is developed. Also, the two views calibration idea is applied to the global SfM pipeline containing N different cameras.
